# 2D-Platform

Mario like 2d Platform created using the new Javascript Library **Kaboom JS**, your goal in the game is to make the most point possible while collecting coin and elimining enemies.

# - Setup
Clone this repo on your favorite IDE and simple copy the path of index.html in your browser.

# - Control
Move the character using left and right keys and space to jump. After adquiring boots your character will be faster for 10 seconds and is able to jump higher. If you grab a pokeball your character can attack pressing down on the keyboard, attacking enemies will give you more points than jumping on them.

# - Documentation
Here is kaboom js page and some other useful pages to get more info about the library

I have no rights for any of the images used on this project since I took them from the internet.
The idea of this mini project was to test the capabilities of kaboom js.
There is more things that I would like to add, like the possibility to save the score on a database to compare with others. Add More scenes and maybe even sound.
